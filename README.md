 Community-Driven Waste Segregation Reporting System
  Problem Statement

Municipal waste management systems often fail to track waste segregation at the household level. This leads to:

Poor recycling efficiency

Increased landfill waste

Lack of accountability

Minimal public participation

Authorities lack real-time data, and households lack motivation and feedback on proper segregation practices.

 Proposed Solution

This project introduces a community-driven reporting platform where:

Households report daily waste segregation practices

Community volunteers verify reports

Municipal authorities monitor compliance through dashboards

Gamification & transparency motivate responsible behavior

Built using the MERN Stack, the system promotes accountability, data-driven decisions, and citizen participation.
